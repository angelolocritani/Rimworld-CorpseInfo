# Corpse info

![Rimworld-CorpseInfoPreview](https://i.imgur.com/lPTIF7l.png)


A mod that adds a link to deceased pawn in order to access their info card even after death

Also add the "Contents" tab to graves, otherwise you cannot select the contained body.

Because it always annoyed me I cannot access the "Records" tab after pawns' death...
